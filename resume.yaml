    I am a self-proclaimed Engineer of Laziness.
    A deep passion for electronics and technology and a burning need to understand how things work drove me to pursue degrees in Physics, Math, and Computer Science.
    Over the last few years, my interests have shifted to living a more DevOps-oriented life by embracing the Rule of Three.
    Delving deeper into DevOps and automation fed into the most wonderfully expensive hobby and passion: Automating Laziness.
    Dubbed 'Automation Queen,' I have automated much of my development, tooling, pipelines, provisioning, validation, and remediation of systems and tedious life tasks and my environment.

      A Delivery Engineer is a position requiring a deep understanding of software development patterns and life-cycle, CI/CD pipelines, DevOps tooling, and mindset.
      Delivery Engineers are assigned to teams to provide the development team with what is necessary to deliver the project.
      Working directly with developers to remove obstacles, improve throughput, automate SDLC, and design, implement, and deploy the infrastructure necessary for the project's success.

        A top client requested a verifiable report detailing the interconnections that meet the expected specifications within six weeks to keep the multi-million dollar per year contract.
        Tasked to me, as one of the few with the skills and knowledge needed, presented to the client five weeks later, the solution I had designed, built, and deployed; later received <a href="#awards">three separate awards</a> for its success.
        Using Ansible to traverse the network via IP tables, ARP tables, IPMI, Redfish, iLO, iDRAC, and LLDP allowed automated validation of in-band and out-of-band network connections between servers, switches, and routers that the client required.
      - >-
        Performing validation, remediation, and verification on hundreds of devices a day is a significant bottleneck in WWT's supply chain, made even worse due to each ITC team's one-off solutions.
        Working with a solutions architect, we built a framework to discover servers, switches, routers, and storage devices using mDNS, PXE, iPXE, and DHCP that generates detailed validation reports. 
        The solution facilitated fully automated validation of internal hardware against expected build configurations, remediation of firmware versions, and upgrading the operating system to match order specifications.
        We provided a single, fully automated solution that, for our test team, improved throughput from 10 a day to 60 devices a day without any errors.
      - Initiated a weekly self-paced training session to explore concepts, terminology, and processes used in both software and DevOps, improving the communication and cohesion between members of these teams.
      - To improve the usability and maintainability of projects used by teams in the ITC, I wrote custom Ansible plugins for simplifying complicated task logic, inventory, and logging requirements. Now used by 11 teams, it reduced the support requests to developers from 3 a day to once a week or less.

      Teagan's ability to look at a complex problem and reduce it, quickly I
      might add, into an extendable and reusable architecture is surpassed by no
      software engineer I have ever worked with. In the matter of 3 hours she
      had designed and beta spec'ed the architecture for a commission/invoice
      integration with a financial system; it was approved by the client in ONE
      meeting. 
      
      I have had the pleasure of knowing Teagan for the past three years now,
      and have worked side by side with her for the last year. I can say without
      a doubt that if she quit her current job, I'd likely be applying to her
      new job; She is that great to work with, always honest and always
      knowledgeable of the task at hand. 
      
      Teagan is a relentless scholar, either from the academic perspective
      nearly having four degrees to the community side and her continual
      contribution to open source. Teagan also is enthralled with automation and
      has taken it upon herself to automate her home and daily life where
      possible.
  - name: Alan Janis
    reference: >-
      Teagan is the kind of engineer who can be intimidating to work with 
      because of her breadth and depth of knowledge, and ability to pick up new 
      software, skills, and practices seemingly overnight. However, she is wiling to
      share and even mentor in these areas which I feel increases her value to her team, 
      the company, and outside members of any project that she is tasked with. 
      I know that she sometimes struggles with how her message comes across in conversation,
      but she is quick to acknowledge a mistake, take it to heart, apologize and take 
      corrective action. Teagan is a fantastic asset and addition to any team or project,
      not just because of her skill set, but because of her diligence and experience taking
      point on difficult projects and tasks, seeing them through to completion. 
      She has technical mastery of many programming languages, architectures, development 
      methodologies, and well as significant knowledge of underlying systems 
      (bare metal, KVM, cloud providers, etc.)

      Teagan has been a joy to work with. I’ve been on two engagements with her now, and she 
      consistently brings positive energy. She is intelligent, confident, outspoken, and 
      opinionated, and I mean those things for the compliment that they are. Teagan is also 
      humble, caring, kind, and not afraid to admit when she is wrong. She is considerate 
      of the feelings of others and quick to resolve conflict. Teagan has a passion for 
      continuous improvement, particularly when it comes to automation. She loves to share 
      her work with others whenever given a chance. She loves to teach and has a lot of good 
      things to share. When I expressed a desire to understand programming better, she started 
      a class for people like me. On the Psyclops Team, she paired with developers (regardless 
      of the stack) and QAs and brought a wealth of value in her first few days as an employee. 
      On the JPMC-NAIC automation project, she quickly picked up on abstract concepts she had 
      previously had little experience with.
