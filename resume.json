Tasked to me, as one of the few who had the skills and knowledge needed. I presented to the client, 5 weeks later, the solution I had designed, built, and deployed; which later received <a href=\"#awards\">3 separate awards</a> for its success. A service that utilized in-band and out-of-band connections matching source ports to their destination port through the use of IP tables, ARP tables, IPMI, Redfish, iLO, iDRAC, and LLDP automated validation of in-band and out-of-band network connections between servers, switches, and routers using Ansible to traverse the network connections.",
        "Performing validation, remediation, and verification on hundreds of devices a day is a major bottleneck in WWT's supply chain, made even worse due to the one-off solutions each ITC team seems to have come up with themselves. Working with a solutions architect, we built a framework to discover servers, switches, routers, and storage devices using services like mDNS, PXE, iPXE, and DHCP; and generate detailed reports using numerous CLI tools, BMC management tools, and on-board RedFish REST API. Facilitating fully automated validation of internal hardware against expected build configurations, remediation of firmware versions, and upgrading the operating system to match required specifications. Providing a single, fully automated solution that, for our test team, improved throughput from 10 a day to 60 devices a day without any errors.",

I can say without a doubt that if she quit her current job, I'd likely be applying to her new job; She is that great to work with, always honest and always knowledgeable of the task at hand. \n \nTeagan is a relentless scholar, either from the academic perspective nearly having four degrees to the community side and her continual contribution to open source.
